 # 🔥 Relaxation of Superalloy at High Temperature during Cyclic Loading – Machine Learning Predictions

This project applies machine learning techniques to model and predict the relaxation behavior of superalloy materials subjected to high temperature cyclic loading. Understanding relaxation behavior is crucial for aerospace, turbine, and high-temperature engineering applications, where superalloys must withstand extreme thermal and mechanical stress.

The goal of this project is to analyze material behavior under repeated thermal cycles and develop ML-based predictive models that estimate relaxation characteristics with high accuracy.

## 🧪 Problem Description

Superalloys experience **stress relaxation** when exposed to:
- High temperature
- Repeated mechanical loading
- Thermal cycling

This project predicts:
- Relaxation rate
- Stress drop values
- Material response trends during cyclic loading

Machine learning helps capture nonlinear patterns that traditional material models may struggle with, enabling better prediction and material design insights.
